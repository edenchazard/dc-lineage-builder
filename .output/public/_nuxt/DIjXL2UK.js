However, for sprites where permission has been granted to host off-site, Lineage Builder will use locally stored copies. These images are exactly as they appear on DC, whereas fallback images may appear slightly blurry. </p><section data-v-239634b7><h3 data-v-239634b7>Breed removal</h3><p data-v-239634b7> Breeds can be removed at any time at the request of the spriter, just contact me on the forum. </p></section></section><section data-v-239634b7><h2 data-v-239634b7>Terms of Use</h2><p data-v-239634b7> Have fun!
