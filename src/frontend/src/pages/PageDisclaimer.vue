      <h2>Art Usage</h2>
      <p>As sprites require permission from their makers to host off-site, most dragons are rendered with style positioning and hotlinking to dragon images hosted on DC as a fallback. However, for sprites where permission has been granted to host off-site, Lineage Builder will use locally stored copies. These images are exactly as they appear on DC, whereas fallback images may appear slightly blurry.</p>
